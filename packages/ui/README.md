Shared UI components for ReLoy.

Components in this package rely on the design tokens exposed in
`@reloy/design-tokens`. When customizing ShadCN/UI components, use Tailwind
classes such as `bg-primary` or `rounded-md` which map directly to these tokens.

## Assets

- `Logo`
- `AuthLeftBg`
- `AuthRightBg`
- `AuthIllustration`
- `BottomLeftLeftSection`
- `BottomRightSection`
- `TopRightLeftSection`
